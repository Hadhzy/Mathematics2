Limits are values that a function approaches as it goes to a certain point. 

There are numerous ways to find limits: direct substitution, factor and reduce or multiply by the conjugate, and L'Hopital's rule, limits can be also determinated graphically.

\textbf{Note}: Approaching a value doesn't mean reaching it. It's fine if the function doesn't reach the value, as long as it gets close to it.

\highlightmath{
\[
\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x}{x^2}
\]
}
\textbf{Read as}: The limit as \( x \) approaches 2 of \( x \) over \( x \) squared.
